# n8n Integration

Lucid provides n8n community nodes for visual workflow automation. Connect AI inference, passport management, and receipt verification into your n8n workflows.

## Available Nodes

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Lucid Inference** | Run chat completions via TrustGate |
| **Lucid Passport** | Create, read, update, delete passports |
| **Lucid Receipt** | Get and verify inference receipts |
| **Lucid Epoch** | Query epoch status and on-chain anchoring |
| **Lucid Agent** | Trigger agent orchestration pipelines |

## Setup

### 1. Install the Community Node

In your n8n instance, go to **Settings → Community Nodes** and install:

```
n8n-nodes-lucid
```

Or install via CLI:

```bash
cd ~/.n8n
npm install n8n-nodes-lucid
```

### 2. Configure Credentials

1. Go to **Credentials → Add Credential → Lucid API**
2. Enter your API key from the [Dashboard](https://app.lucid.foundation)
3. Set the base URL (default: `https://api.lucid.foundation`)

### 3. Use in Workflows

Drag any Lucid node from the sidebar into your workflow canvas.

## Example: Verified AI Chatbot

```
[Webhook Trigger] → [Lucid Inference] → [Lucid Receipt Verify] → [IF verified] → [Slack Post]
```

This workflow:
1. Receives a webhook with a user question
2. Runs inference through Lucid (with receipt)
3. Verifies the receipt signature
4. If valid, posts the verified answer to Slack

## Example: Model Monitoring

```
[Cron (hourly)] → [Lucid Passport List] → [Loop] → [Lucid Inference (test)] → [IF latency > 2s] → [Email Alert]
```

This workflow:
1. Runs hourly via cron trigger
2. Lists all active passports
3. Sends a test inference to each model
4. Alerts if any model's latency exceeds the threshold

## Node Configuration

Each Lucid node exposes these common fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Operation** | The specific action (e.g., create, list, verify) |
| **Passport ID** | Target passport for the operation |
| **Parameters** | Operation-specific parameters (JSON or individual fields) |

Output data is available as JSON for downstream nodes via n8n expressions like `{{ $json.receipt.id }}`.
