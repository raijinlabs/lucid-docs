# MCPGate

**MCPGate** is an open-source tool gateway that exposes 88+ services as [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers. AI agents use MCPGate to discover and invoke tools across SaaS platforms, blockchains, and APIs.

## How It Works

```
AI Agent → MCPGate (:4020) → Credential Adapter → Target Service
```

1. An agent searches for tools using **semantic discovery** (TF-IDF across 1000+ tools)
2. MCPGate resolves credentials via the **CredentialAdapter** chain
3. The tool call is routed to the target MCP server
4. Results are returned with audit logging and metering

## Builtin Servers

88+ MCP server integrations across domains:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Finance / Crypto** | Binance, Coinbase, Jupiter, Uniswap, Aave, DeFiLlama, Polymarket |
| **Collaboration** | Slack, Discord, Notion, Jira, Linear, Asana, Monday, Trello |
| **Google Suite** | Drive, Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Gmail |
| **DevOps** | GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, Railway |
| **Communication** | Telegram, Microsoft Teams |

## Credential Management

MCPGate uses pluggable **CredentialAdapters** to manage service credentials:

| Adapter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **EnvVarAdapter** | Read tokens from environment variables |
| **DatabaseAdapter** | AES-256-GCM encrypted credential store in Postgres |
| **CompositeAdapter** | Chain multiple adapters with fallback priority |

```typescript
// Example: composite adapter with env fallback
const adapter = new CompositeAdapter([
  new DatabaseAdapter(db, encryptionKey),
  new EnvVarAdapter(),
]);

const token = await adapter.getToken("github", agentId);
```

## Session Budgets

Cap agent resource usage per session:

```typescript
const session = await mcpgate.sessions.create({
  agentId: "agent-123",
  budget: {
    maxToolCalls: 50,
    maxCostUsd: 1.00,
    maxDurationMs: 300000,  // 5 minutes
    enforcement: "hard",     // reject calls over budget
  },
});
```

## Tool Discovery

Find tools using natural language:

```
GET /tools/search?q=send+slack+message
```

Returns ranked results using TF-IDF semantic matching across all registered servers and tools.

## Chain Execution

Execute multi-step tool chains as a DAG:

```typescript
const result = await mcpgate.chains.execute({
  steps: [
    { id: "fetch", tool: "github.get_issue", params: { number: 42 } },
    { id: "notify", tool: "slack.post_message", params: {
      channel: "#eng",
      text: "Issue #42: {{fetch.title}} — {{fetch.status}}"
    }},
  ],
});
```

Variable interpolation (`{{step.field}}`) connects steps automatically.
