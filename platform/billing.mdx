## Usage-Based Pricing

Beyond plan limits, usage is metered per-request:

| Metric | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Additional requests | $0.001/request |
| Input tokens | Pass-through from provider |
| Output tokens | Pass-through from provider |
| On-chain anchoring | $0.01/epoch |
| MCPGate tool calls | $0.002/call |

Token costs are the upstream provider rate (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) plus a small routing fee.

## Manage Billing

Billing is managed through Stripe via the [Dashboard → Settings → Billing](https://app.lucid.foundation/settings/billing).

From the billing page you can:
- View current plan and usage
- Upgrade or downgrade plans
- Update payment method
- Download invoices
- Set spending alerts

## Invoices

Invoices are generated monthly and available in the dashboard. They include:
- Plan subscription fee
- Usage-based charges (broken down by metric)
- Any credits or adjustments

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

On the Pro and Enterprise plans, you can use your own provider API keys. In BYOK mode, Lucid doesn't charge for token costs — only the routing and infrastructure fees apply.

```typescript
// Configure BYOK in the dashboard or via API
await lucid.settings.update({
  byokKeys: {
    openai: "sk-...",
    anthropic: "sk-ant-...",
  },
});
```
